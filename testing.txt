Devin, a male, who is 20-year-old college sophomore, lived on campus. 
He is studying at home during the covid lock down. Devin has a younger sister who is 12-year-old. And they are the only 2 childen of a married couple that live in Denver Colorado.

Devin was very althletic in high school, but is not as active in college due to the heavy study load he has as a double major. He would like to have an safe activity that he can share with his sister while he is home. So they decide to adopt a dog to have a walking campanion for he and his sisiter.
Devin is savvy with computer and latest technology. He owns a regular laptop computer, but has a latest Apple mobile device.

Tested the site on
- iPhone 5 with Safari
- laptop with Firebox and Chrome

Overall the site performed well functionally on all three browsers.
Firefox was the default browser I used when developing the site, thus it performed as expected.

On iPhone
The Checkout page performed poorly. The fields were too small for filling out the info so are problematic. This page did not employ flexbox feature and it showed. Partly due to the fact that the site was initially developed with the desktop layout first, instead of the mobile first strategy. Will change that process for the next project.

On Chrome
The browser adds additional content with dogcard’s altert box which was unexpected, but is not a major issue. I can live with that for now. But, like to investigate a fix with code.

This issue affect all browsers
- The Adopt and Checkout buttons failed the color contrast test on https://webaim.org/.
- Would go back to the designers and suggest them to choose a darker color or change the button text from white to black to ensure the site meets the WCAG 2.0 level AA requires a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal text.

To Do
- Need to add interaction behaviors with css on all buttons to improve the site’s usability. This simple fix will give users the sorely missed feedback when they are interacting with the site.
- Need to add form error prevention and validation as well.
